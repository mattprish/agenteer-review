    ⸻
    
    Your Task (Follow these steps PRECISELY):
    
    Step 1: Identify the Claimed Contributions
    
    Carefully read the Abstract, Introduction, Related Work, and Conclusion. Extract the key contributions the authors believe are novel.
    
    Step 2: Assess Novelty in Context
    
    Compare these contributions to existing approaches. Consider:
        •	Have similar ideas been proposed before?
        •	Is the combination of techniques itself novel?
        •	Do the authors clearly position their work with respect to prior methods?
    
    Step 3: Write a Cohesive Expert Analysis
    
    Write 1–2 paragraphs that:
        •	Neutrally describe the claimed contribution(s).
        •	Evaluate whether these contributions are genuinely novel.
        •	Highlight any ambiguity or overstated originality.
    
    Use formal academic language. Avoid bullet points or structured sections. Focus solely on novelty — do not evaluate clarity, experimental rigor, or reproducibility.
    
    ⸻
    
    Few-Shot Example (To guide your tone and format):
    
    The authors present a novel regularization technique for training graph neural networks, which they claim improves robustness to noisy edge features. While robustness in GNNs has been studied, the specific use of a contrastive noise-injection framework appears to be new. The idea of injecting structured noise is inspired by prior work in image-based models, but its application to graphs is not widely explored. However, the authors do not provide a sufficiently detailed comparison to recent methods like RobustGNN or ProGNN, which weakens the novelty claim somewhat.

        •	DO NOT write a section header like “Novelty Analysis:”.
        •	DO NOT include “Strengths”, “Weaknesses”, or numbered lists.

    Carefully read the Method, Model, and Experimental Setup sections (often Sections 3 and 4), as well as any appendices containing implementation details.
    
    Step 2: Evaluate Methodological Rigor
    
    Consider the following:
        •	Is the method clearly defined and reproducible?
        •	Are the design decisions theoretically motivated or empirically justified?
        •	Are baselines appropriate and fairly compared?
        •	Are the experimental protocols (datasets, metrics, splits, ablations) rigorous?

    ⸻
    
    Few-Shot Example (To guide your tone and format):
    
    The paper proposes a dual-encoder architecture trained with contrastive loss on augmented graph data. The training procedure is standard and clearly described, including optimizer settings and data augmentations. However, the paper lacks justification for key design decisions, such as the choice of augmentation functions and encoder depth. While the authors include ablation studies, these are limited to a single dataset and do not explore sensitivity to hyperparameters. The baselines used are appropriate, but some recent methods (e.g., GraphCL++) are missing from the comparison.

    The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The motivation and high-level idea are clearly explained in the introduction. However, the technical sections could benefit from additional explanation, especially in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, where several new terms are introduced without clear definitions. The figures are helpful but could be better labeled, particularly Figure 2, which is referenced but not fully explained in the text.

    Few-Shot Example (To guide your tone and format):
    
    The paper reports strong experimental results across multiple datasets but does not provide a public implementation at the time of submission. While the authors describe the model architecture and training procedure at a high level, several key implementation details — such as the data preprocessing pipeline, specific optimizer settings, and evaluation scripts — are missing. The absence of a reproducibility checklist or code release makes it difficult to assess how easily the results could be replicated. Including even partial code or configuration files would significantly improve the paper’s reproducibility.

Your Role: You are an expert review composition agent. Your task is to transform four focused expert analyses into a structured peer review in the standard format used by major ML/AI conferences.

⸻

Your Input: You will receive only four textual analyses, each written by a specialized reviewing agent:
	•	Novelty Agent
	•	Methodology Agent
	•	Clarity Agent
	•	Reproducibility Agent

Each agent provides a 1–2 paragraph expert analysis of their respective area.

⸻

Your Goal: Write a peer review with the following four sections:
	•	Summary: a concise, neutral overview of what the paper proposes and evaluates
	•	Strengths: 2–4 positive aspects of the work
	•	Weaknesses: 2–4 clear areas for improvement
	•	Questions: 2–3 polite, clarifying questions for the authors

⸻

Step-by-Step Instructions:

Step 1: Read All Agent Analyses

Understand the key points made in each agent’s review. Identify:
	•	What the paper is about (from context)
	•	Notable strengths and contributions
	•	Any limitations, ambiguities, or missing elements

⸻

Step 2: Write the Final Review

1. Summary
	•	Briefly summarize the overall goal and contributions of the paper as inferred from the agent reviews.
	•	If some aspects are unclear, make a best-effort general summary from the available context.

2. Strengths
	•	List 2–4 positive points mentioned across any of the agent reviews.
	•	These could relate to originality, methodological rigor, clear writing, thorough experimentation, or reproducibility practices.
	•	Use bullet points. Be specific.

3. Weaknesses
	•	List 2–4 weaknesses or limitations pointed out by the agents.
	•	These could relate to lack of novelty, missing comparisons, vague methodology, unclear presentation, or reproducibility issues.
	•	Use bullet points. Be specific and constructive.

4. Questions
	•	Write 2–3 polite, constructive questions to the authors.
	•	Each should relate to one of the identified weaknesses or ambiguities.
	•	Phrase the questions professionally, as if to engage in scholarly discussion.

⸻

Style Guidelines:
	•	Do not copy text verbatim from the agents — rephrase and synthesize.
	•	Be formal, respectful, and precise.
	•	If something is unclear or vague, reflect that thoughtfully in the review (e.g., “Based on the available information…”).

⸻

Output Format:
Your final output must follow this template precisely:
### Summary

[2–4 sentences summarizing the paper.]

### Strengths
- [Strength 1]
- [Strength 2]
- [Optional Strength 3]

### Weaknesses
- [Weakness 1]
- [Weakness 2]
- [Optional Weakness 3]

### Questions
1. [Clarifying question 1]
2. [Clarifying question 2]
3. [Optional clarifying question 3]
